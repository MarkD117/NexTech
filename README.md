## UI/UX

### Design Overview
The primary objective of the website is to offer users a curated selection of products tailored to the needs of computer enthusiasts. With an intuitive design at its core, our platform prioritizes simplicity and ease of navigation. Products are prominently displayed across various pages, encouraging users to explore further, while bold colors are strategically used to enhance visibility and attract attention. The commitment to seamless user experience is evident in every aspect of the site, with effortless accessibility and self-explanatory features. On-screen feedback messages are employed to guide users effectively, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme of the site was carefully selected to create a visually appealing and cohesive user experience. Rich black serves as the primary color for all text elements throughout the site, ensuring clear readability and a sleek aesthetic. It is also strategically employed alongside other blue buttons to accentuate differences between various interactive elements. Complementing the richness of black, white is utilized for the site background, providing a clean canvas for content and enhancing contrast. Additionally, white is applied to icons and text displayed on blue or black backgrounds, ensuring optimal visibility and legibility across all interfaces.

In terms of accent colors, Chrysler Blue takes center stage in the navigation menu, adding a pop of vibrancy and guiding users seamlessly through different sections of the site. This bold hue also doubles as a hover effect on Palatinate Blue buttons, enhancing interactivity and user engagement. Chrysler Blue is also applied to the prices of products, making them stand out more and catching the attention of users browsing through the offerings on the site. Palatinate Blue serves as the predominant color for most buttons on the site, offering a harmonious blend of sophistication and functionality. Finally, Periwinkle adds a touch of softness and elegance as the background color for product cards, providing a pleasant backdrop for showcasing the curated selection of products. Together, these carefully chosen colors contribute to a visually appealing and intuitive browsing experience for users.
